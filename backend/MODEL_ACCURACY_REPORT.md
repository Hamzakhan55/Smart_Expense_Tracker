### 2. MiniLM-V2 (Text Classification)
- **Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL
- **Model Type**: Fine-tuned MiniLM-V2
- **Purpose**: Classify expense descriptions into categories
- **Location**: `backend/models/MiniLM-V2/fine-tuned-minilm-advanced/`

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Overall Accuracy**: 82.93% (34/41 test cases)
- **Model Loading**: ✅ Successful
- **Inference Time**: <1ms per classification
- **Categories Supported**: 15 categories

#### Detailed Category Performance:

| Category | Accuracy | Correct/Total | Performance |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Food & Drinks | 100.0% | 5/5 | ✅ Excellent |
| Transport | 100.0% | 5/5 | ✅ Excellent |
| Healthcare | 100.0% | 5/5 | ✅ Excellent |
| Rent | 100.0% | 3/3 | ✅ Excellent |
| Education | 100.0% | 4/4 | ✅ Excellent |
| Entertainment | 100.0% | 3/3 | ✅ Excellent |
| Utilities | 80.0% | 4/5 | ✅ Good |
| Shopping | 60.0% | 3/5 | ⚠️ Needs Improvement |
| Bills | 33.3% | 1/3 | ❌ Poor |
| Electronics & Gadgets | 33.3% | 1/3 | ❌ Poor |

#### Common Misclassifications:
1. **"gas cylinder 900"** → Classified as Transport (Expected: Utilities)
2. **"shopping at mall 3000"** → Classified as Transport (Expected: Shopping)
3. **"amazon purchase 1500"** → Classified as Entertainment (Expected: Shopping)
4. **"phone bill payment 500"** → Classified as Utilities (Expected: Bills)
5. **"laptop purchase 60000"** → Classified as Utilities (Expected: Electronics & Gadgets)

## Overall System Assessment

### Strengths:
1. **High Accuracy Categories**: Food & Drinks, Transport, Healthcare, Rent, Education, Entertainment all achieve 100% accuracy
2. **Fast Inference**: MiniLM-V2 provides near-instantaneous classification
3. **Robust Model Loading**: Both models load successfully without dependency issues
4. **Good Overall Performance**: 82.93% accuracy is above the 80% threshold for production use

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Bills Category**: Only 33.3% accuracy - model confuses bills with utilities
2. **Electronics & Gadgets**: Only 33.3% accuracy - needs better training data
3. **Shopping Category**: 60% accuracy - some shopping terms misclassified as transport/entertainment
4. **Whisper Performance**: High inference time (27 seconds) may impact user experience

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Retrain MiniLM-V2** with more diverse examples for:
   - Bills vs Utilities distinction
   - Electronics & Gadgets category
   - Shopping-related terms

2. **Optimize Whisper Model**:
   - Consider using Whisper-medium or Whisper-small for faster inference
   - Implement GPU acceleration if available
   - Add audio preprocessing to improve transcription quality

### Training Data Improvements:
1. **Bills Category**: Add more examples like "credit card bill", "loan payment", "subscription fee"
2. **Electronics**: Include terms like "laptop", "computer", "gadget", "device"
3. **Shopping**: Better distinguish between general shopping and specific categories

### Model Configuration:
1. **Category Mapping**: Improve the mapping between model predictions and frontend categories
2. **Confidence Thresholds**: Implement confidence scoring to handle uncertain predictions
3. **Fallback Logic**: Enhanced keyword-based classification for low-confidence predictions

## Production Readiness

### Current Status: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION
- Overall accuracy of 82.93% meets production standards
- Both models operational and stable
- Core functionality working as expected

### Monitoring Recommendations:
1. Track classification accuracy in production
2. Collect user feedback on misclassifications
3. Monitor Whisper transcription quality
4. Log inference times for performance optimization
